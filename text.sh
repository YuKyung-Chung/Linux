No great man ever complains of want of opportunity.
Do not accustom yourself to use big words for little matters.
A day without laughter is a day wasted.
Patterning your life around others opinions is nothing more than slavery.
love what you have.
It aint over till its over.
Life is not fair, get used to it.
Only I can change my life, No one can do it for me.
The unexamined life is not worth living.
